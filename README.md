# Lumos
<p> LUMOS, a hand gesture control system for light bulbs that aims to make technology more accessible and user-friendly for a variety of individuals, including those with physical impairments and those who prefer a more intuitive and convenient way to control their lights. Our system will recognize a set of predefined gestures, and map them to specific actions, like turning the lights on and off or adjusting the brightness

Additionally, our solution addresses the limitations of existing systems by allowing multiple users to create their own user profiles with their own preferred gestures.

 Our ultimate goal is to design and develop an app that allows users ,specially bedridden or mute  to control their lighting system in their room without the need for verbal or third-party assistance, providing an intuitive and convenient way to control their lights.
